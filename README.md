<strong>Requirements:</strong>

Build a filterable Javascript table that displays all the star wars starships from the following feed http://swapi.co/api/starships/
Display all attributes as separate sortable and filterable columns.
Code should be as clean and as easy to read as possible.
Bonus points for responsive design.
Bonus points for styling.
You may use any IDE/Build tool of your choice.

<strong>Solution:</strong>

I built this in Angular JS with Bootstrap 4.

I pulled down the Data from http://swapi.co/api/starships/ and displayed this in a responsive table using bootstrap.

The data can be filtered via columns that can be turned on or off.

The data is searchable and sortable via the table headers.
